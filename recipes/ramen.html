        <li>450g boneless pork shoulder or loin</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
        <li>1 piece ginger, sliced</li>
        <li>3 green onions, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>250ml soy sauce</li>
        <li>60ml sake</li>
        <li>2 tbsp <i>mirin</i></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Ramen Toppings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chaushu slices</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>Bamboo shoots</li>
        <li>Nori</li>
        <li>Green Onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>Rinse the chicken bones in cold water, then place them in a large pot with the water, pork, garlic, ginger, and green onions.</p>
    <p>Bring to the boil, removing the dirt that comes to the surface. Lower the heat and simmer with the pot covered for around two hours.</p>
    <p>Remove the pork, then strain off the broth, getting rid of the other ingredients.</p>
    <p>Add the soy sauce, sake, and mirin, then leave to simmer with the pot covered until ready to serve.</p>
    <p>Mix the ingredients for the chashu sauce in a large pan. Add the pork, then bring to the boil over a medium heat. Cover with a lid, leaving slightly open so the steam can escape, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for around 30 minutes, turning the meat from time to time until just a little bit of liquid is left.</p>
    <p>Remove the lid, stay with the pan, and watch the liquid simmer until bubbles start to appear.</p>
    <p>Turn the pork to cover it completely with the sauce, then remove from the pan and slice thinly.</p>
    <p>When ready to serve, cook the ramen following the instructions on the packaging. Divide the broth into six bowls, then add the noodles, pork, bamboo shoots, soy-marinated eggs, and green onions.</p>
    <p>Serve hot.</p>
